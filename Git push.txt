Sure, I can guide you through the process of creating a repository on GitHub and pushing your code to it using Git commands. Here are the steps:

Initialize a Git repository: Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, Terminal, etc.) and navigate to your "WAD Final" folder on your Desktop using the cd command.
bash
Copy code
cd Desktop/WAD\ Final
Then, initialize a new Git repository in this folder.
bash
Copy code
git init
Add your files to the repository: Add all the files in your folder to the staging area.
bash
Copy code
git add .
This command adds all the files in the folder to the staging area. If you want to add specific files, you can replace . with the file names.
Commit your changes: Commit the files you've added to the staging area.
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Replace "Initial commit" with an appropriate commit message describing the changes you've made.
Create a new repository on GitHub: Go to GitHub.com, log in to your account, and click on the "+" icon in the top right corner of the page. Then, select "New repository". Follow the instructions to create a new repository. Do not initialize it with a README, as you've already initialized your repository locally.
Add GitHub repository as remote: After creating the repository on GitHub, you need to add it as a remote to your local repository.
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository_URL>
Replace <repository_URL> with the URL of your GitHub repository. You can find this URL on your repository's page on GitHub.
Push your code to GitHub: Finally, push your code to the GitHub repository.
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
This command will push the code from your local master branch to the master branch of the repository on GitHub. If you're using a different branch name, replace master with your branch name.
That's it! Your code should now be pushed to your GitHub repository. You can verify this by visiting your repository on GitHub.com.
